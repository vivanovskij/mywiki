The diary helps you make daily notes. You can easily add information into
Vimwiki that should be sorted out later. Just hit <Leader>w<Leader>w to create
a new note for today with a name based on the current date.

To generate the diary section with all available links one can use
|:VimwikiDiaryGenerateLinks| or <Leader>w<Leader>i .

Note: it works only for diary index file.

Example of diary section: >
    = Diary =

    == 2011 ==

    === December ===
        * [[2011-12-09]]
        * [[2011-12-08]]


See |g:vimwiki_diary_months| if you would like to rename months.

Calendar integration                                        *vimwiki-calendar*

If you have Calendar.vim installed you can use it to create diary notes.
Just open calendar with :Calendar and tap <Enter> on the date. A wiki file
will be created in the default wiki's diary.

Get it from http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=52

See |g:vimwiki_use_calendar| option to turn it off/on.

Markdown export

If you use markdown as the syntax for your wiki, there is a rubygem available
at https://github.com/patrickdavey/vimwiki_markdown which you can use to
convert the wiki markdown files into html.

Also, See |vimwiki-option-html_filename_parameterization| for supporting
functionality.
