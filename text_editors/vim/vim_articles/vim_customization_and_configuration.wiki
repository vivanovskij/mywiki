= Vim: Tutorial on Customization and Configuration =

=== Initialization ===
:h .vimrc

First, initialize (if defined) the system vimrc (see :version)

$VIM/vimrc

Then, initialize the first found of the following user vimrc
configurations:

$VIMINIT
$HOME/.vimrc
$HOME/.vim/vimrc
$EXINIT
$HOME/.exrc
$VIMRUNTIME/defaults/.vim

=== Plugin / Package Scripts ===
:h load-plugins

First, plugin scripts are loaded, which is equivalent to running
    :runtime! plugin/**/*.vim
Usually, this is $HOME/.vim/plugin/**/*.vim

Then packages are loaded...

Usually, this is $HOME/.vim/pach/foo/start/bar/plugin/**/*.vim


=== Runtimepath ===
:h runtimepath
runtimepath - a list of directories which will be searched for runtime files

You'll usually only add to 1. and 5., but will often examine 3. (system runtime)
Search order:
1. User Home .vim
2. Sysadmin folder
3. $VIMRUNTIME
4. Sysadmin "after" folder
5. User Home "after" folder

Each of the runtimepath directories (default 5) has this dir structure:
* syntax/
* compiler/
* ftdetect/
* filetype.vim
* scripts.vim
* autoload/
* ftplugin/
* plugin/
* pack/
* colors/
* doc/
* import/
* keymap/
* lang/
* menu.vim
* print/
* spell/
* tutor
* indent/

$ :set rtp?
"=&rtp (скопировать runtimepath в буфер)

==== syntax/ ====
Enable customizing syntax highlighting
When inviking :set syntax=xxx, syntax file(s) named xxx.vim are sourced from
the runtimepath. Usually, an autocommand does this if filetype can be
inferred.
